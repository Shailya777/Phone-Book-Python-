# Python PhoneBook ðŸ“ž

A simple text-based PhoneBook app built as a mini-project to practice Python functions, control flow, input handling, and simple data I/O with CSV files (using csv module).

## Features
- Add, view, search, and delete contacts.
- Partial search by name, phone, email, or birth date.
- Duplicate prevention, input validation, and error handling.
- Saves all contacts to CSV.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run in the terminal:
   python PhoneBook.py

## Concepts Used
- Functions.
- Conditional statements & loops.
- Try/Except.
- File I/O with CSV.
- Input validation (regex, date checks).
- Simple CLI design.

## What I Learned
- Understood immense power of seemingly simple loops and conditional control flow logic.
- Debugged tricky loop and input logic.
- Better understanding of file error-handing and data validation.
- Understanding of importance of modular code writing.
